Please make sure that your antivirus is temporarily disabled. (Real-time scan)
Since this is a Bot that automatically executes many commands, it may be falsely marked as a virus due to the fact that it is a Bot. There are no real viruses in my Repositories, so there is nothing to worry about. After you disable the antivirus, you should have a folder ready, preferably in your "Documents" folder.
Note that you should not have parent folders with spaces in the name, otherwise some settings won't work.
I have no idea why this is causing the problem, but it happened to me. I'm not entirely sure, but feel free to check it yourself.
I will try to find a solution to this problem soon. Please see the example below if you don't understand:
